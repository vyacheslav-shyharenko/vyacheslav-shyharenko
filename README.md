# Slava Shyharenko

Hi there 👋 I'm a frontend developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, interactive web interfaces.

### What I do
- Build responsive layouts and reusable components from scratch
- Add life to pages with scroll animations, modals, and transitions
- Organize project structure so it’s easy to work with — not just for me

### My tools
`React`, `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `SCSS`, `Vite`, `Git`

### A few projects I’ve worked on
- 🌿 **[GreenHarvest](https://github.com/vyacheslav-shyharenko/GreenHarvest)** — a team project where I focused on layout, form validation, and Git collaboration
- 🖼️ **[Gallery](https://github.com/vyacheslav-shyharenko/Gallery)** — an experiment with CSS Grid and adaptive image layout
- 💻 **[WebStudio](https://github.com/vyacheslav-shyharenko/WebStudio)** — my first full static site, where I learned the power of clean HTML & CSS

### A bit about me
I value structure, clarity, and speed. I used to manage teams at McDonald's, where I learned to stay calm and solve problems fast — now I bring that same mindset to code.
